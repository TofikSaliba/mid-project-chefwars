# Chef Wars! AppleSeeds Mid Project

## Description
I created this website, out of adoration for CodeWars, where as a junior developer im having so much fun there!
since i love cooking, and in the lasdt period we got to stay alot at home... i choose Chefwars a website for food recipies as my project, 1 option is to get them from API..the other is from users that can add recipies, get rated and climb in level. which is the competetive part, compared to codeWars.


## Technologies:
- react
- css
- Firebase: Google Authentication & Firestore database


## Implementation used
- API
- CRUD
- ROUTING
- useState, useContext, useEffect
- Google Login

# others

## Future Plans
- adding favorite recipies to users
- refactoring code to use styled components and SASS
- Editing comments option, and option to reply to comments
- adding images and videos by uploading files and not via links only
- top 5 recipies in the home page
- adding more search and filtering options
- more login options, such as facebook, twitter etc...
- users DMs
