# Chef Wars!

## Description
I created this website, out of adoration for CodeWars, where as a junior developer im having so much fun there!
since i love cooking, and in the lasdt period we got to stay alot at home... i choose Chefwars a website for food recipies as my project, 1 option is to get them from API..the other is from users that can add recipies, get rated and climb in level. which is the competetive part, compared to codeWars.


## Technologies:
- react


## API, CRUD , ROUTING, Google Login, useState, useContext, useEffect and more ..

### AppleSeeds Mid Project

### Developer: Tofik Saliba
